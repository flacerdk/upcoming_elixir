# Upcoming

This is work-in-progress. When finished it'll implement a tool for making Spotify playlists from upcoming concerts in a city. The idea comes from [this blog post](https://kyleconroy.com/upcoming).

Right now it doesn't do anything useful, though. I'm using this as a way to learn a bit of Elixir, so stay tuned.
